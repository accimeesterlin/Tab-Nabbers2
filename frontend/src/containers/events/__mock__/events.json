Campers learn the fundamentals of web technologies to create, code, and produce their own project-based website. Camp ends with a special showcase presentation for family and friends.\nStudents work side-by-side with professionals in the field of computer science during this intensive, five-day workshops. They will learn not only the fundamentals of web technologies but will also experience how a real-world project moves through its lifecycle.\nEvery session provides students with an opportunity to take a hands-on approach to their projects.

You will finish this course with in-depth knowledge of some of the most important aspects of the language.\nTopics covered:\n\n\nFunctions, Conditionals and Loops\n\n\nWho this workshop is for:\nThis workshop is for beginners with very little JavaScript experience. You should complete the prerequisites listed below before attending this mini bootcamp.\nPrerequisites:\nStrongly Recommended (1): Watch and Code up to and including “Interlude - Data types and comparisons”\nStrongly Recommended (2): First four chapters of Eloquent JavaScript\nWhat to bring:\nStudents will need to bring their own laptops! Windows, Mac or Linux will do it!\nInstructors:\nCaleb Cordry, Software Engineer at Google\nCaleb is originally from Kansas City and went to school at the University of Kansas. After spending some time in the financial world in Chicago he decided to head West to California. He now lives in San Francisco and works as a Software Engineer at Google.\nKimerie is a Software Engineer and Senior Analyst within Accenture’s Technology Practice.\n\nPrior to Accenture, Kimerie was an Engineering Fellow at Khan Academy where she worked on improving coach/teacher tools and building Khan Academy’s core test prep products.\n\nIn 2014, Kimerie participated in the inaugural Startup Weekend EDU Oakland where she worked on design and user research. Her team built a voice-to-text analysis app to help ESL students improve language skills that won them 1st place out of 36 teams.\n\nKimerie is passionate about the intersection of tech and education, and she has worked/volunteered throughout her career with organizations that are preparing young people for the demands of the 21st Century. Dedicated to exposing young women and girls to STEM careers, she volunteers with Black Girls Code.\n\nKimerie completed Hack Reactor’s Telegraph Track in 2016. She holds a Master of Public Policy from Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy and a B.A. in French from Spelman College.\n--\nWe look forward to meeting you!",

Or are you just curious about code and ready to learn more? \nJoin Liverpool Girl Geeks for a 6-week course in the language of the web, JavaScript. \nDespite being the most used programming language, JavaScript is often misunderstood; treated as a necessary evil rather than celebrated for its vital role in shaping the web as we know it. However, in the last ten years developments such as jQuery, Backbone, and Angular have slowly but surely brought JavaScript back into fashion. Now an enjoyable and desirable language to work with, there’s never been a better time to learn the foundations.\nJavaScript can and has been used in various ways - in games, chat clients, apps - but this course will focus on JavaScript in its most common role within the web browser.\nYou will not only learn the fundamentals of the language, but how to apply them practically through a series of small projects designed to mimic the day-to-day uses that working engineers put them to.\nThis course is ideal for those thinking about a career change, learners who need to reach a required standard to start a coding bootcamp or for those who simply want to know more about how the internet actually works.\nMeet your tutor...\nYour tutor is Jill Bouchard-Cross, Senior eCommerce Content Developer at ShopDirect. Jill has been coding since she was 12 years old and holds a Master’s of Science specialising in Acoustic Phonetics and a Computer Science Master’s in Information Systems Management. After spending 5 years at an international law firm as an Intranet developer, she has been at Shop Direct for over 2 years where she works building brand store web pages for Very and Littlewoods.\nFee: Early bird (by 5 May) £325 / Standard £375\n-\nWe host our events at accessible venues but if you require any special assistance just let us know and we will do all we can to accommodate you.\nThis course is open to all aged 18+\nThis is a series of workshops held on Tuesdays at 18:00 - 20:00, with the first workshop on 5 June and the final one held on 15 July. \n-\nCancellations and refunds policy\nIf you wish to cancel your booking we can offer a full refund if the cancellation request is received before 5 May at 17:00. For cancellations requested between 17:00 on 5 May - 17:00 on 22 May a 50% refund is available or alternatively, you may transfer to a different start date for a course with a fee up to the same value.
